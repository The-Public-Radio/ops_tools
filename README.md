## CREDITS
This project was begun by Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright, but would not have been possible without the generous help of Andy Warner, Daniel Suo, Suz Hinton, Todd Bailey, and others. Big ups.
In addition, early versions of the hardware and firmware was adapted directly from Nathan Seidle et al (Sparkfun).

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Public Radio is a single channel, single speaker FM receiver. 
As a piece of hardware, it was intended to be as simple as possible. One midrange speaker mounted inside a simple enclosure, with a single switched knob which controls power and adjusts volume.


## CONTAINED HEREIN
A whole bunch of tools. Eventually this repo should contain:
* All of the fixtures and jigs required to mechanically assemble a Public Radio.
* All of the embedded systems tools for programming a Public Radio.
* Software for tuning The Public Radio.
* The fulfillment software & tools used to efficiently process Public Radio orders.

## ELSE
We're new to this game. Holler at me if I'm missing something.
