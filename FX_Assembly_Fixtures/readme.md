The STL files included here will help anyone assemble their own Public Radio. The process goes as follows:
* PR3007 is used first. It holds the nut and PCB while you're installing the antenna screw.
* PR3001 comes next. First you install the four speaker nuts into the fixture, then load the PCB into the fixture too. 
* Then you install PR3002 into the slot in PR3001. Now dry-fit the speaker and make sure it seats nicely. Then remove it, put a few dabs of hot glue on the speaker cutout in the PCB, and install the speaker. 
* Now make sure that the speaker wires aren't in the way of the screw holes that go through the speaker flange and the PCB.
* PR3008 is optionally used at this point. Note that it has holes roughed out in it, but they'll need to be tapped (with an M3 tap) to be useful. Alternately, you can just install your antenna instead.
* Now slide the plastic spacer over the antenna and potentiometer, and then slide the lid in place too.
* Now install the four screws into the lid. Tighten all four loosely, then go back around and make sure they're all snug but not so tight that the lid flexes.

That's it. Enjoy!
